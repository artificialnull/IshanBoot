    "h": "The fact that so many articles still name Ocarina of Time as \"the greatest or most significant or most influential\" video game ever only tells you how far video games still are from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Film critics rank the highly controversial Orson Welles over directors who were highly popular in theaters around the world. Video game critics are still blinded by commercial success. Ocarina of Time sold more than anything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, film critics grow up watching a lot of films of the past. Video game critics are often totally ignorant of the games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Ocarina of Time did anything worthy of being saved.\n\nIn a sense, Ocarina is emblematic of the status of video game criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it FPSes or Mario) and too little to the merits of real games. If somebody composes the most divine game but no major streamer picks it up and sells it around the world, a lot of video game critics will ignore it. If a major streamer picks up a game that is as stereotyped as can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on it. This is the sad status of video game criticism: critics are basically publicists working for major developers, publishers and online stores. They simply highlight what product the video game business wants to make money from.\n\nHopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great developer like Adam Cadre, who never sold much, and commercial products like Ocarina of Time. At such a time, video game critics will study their gaming history and understand which developers accomplished which feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.\n\nOcarina's \"Aryan\" aesthetic removed any trace of colored influence from the adventure genre. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.\n\nContemporary developers never spoke highly of Ocarina of Time, and for good reason. They could never figure out why Ocarina should be regarded more highly than their own games. They knew that it was simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to \"Nintendomania\", which had nothing to do with their artistic merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in its (mediocre) gameplay to this day. Nothing else grants Ocarina of Time more attention than, say, EarthBound or Mega Man. There was nothing intrinsically better in Ocarina. Hideo Kojima of Konami was certainly a far better designer than Miyamoto. SEGA certainly had much more skilled developers. And Shigesato Itoi was a far more accomplished storyteller; not to mention the far greater Japanese video game designers who followed him in subsequent decades or the US designers themselves who initially spearheaded what Miyamoto merely later repackaged to the masses.\n\nOcarina of Time sold a lot of copies not because it was the greatest game but simply because it was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. It had a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and it was photogenic. Were it not for the media craze surrounding it, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial game.",

Don't get me wrong, we ain't talkin bad players, butyou can't even sleep without nightmares of YAYUZZ! Pull it back, hit you with a slo flo. Make the come back like two stocks with so po. Get back to labbin if you spent some time plannin you might stop losing to falcon and maybe even to ganon. I still have faith get back to the big stage, before that you gotta learn to beat KJH. Why you out here making cakes in my face? Try beatin tafo, that's a piece of cake. Kira and Reno, why they still bop you, my man still out here losing to Ghatzu. Hugs this year loooking real shaky son. How many ganons you beat lately? N0ne. You need to reflect like alex19, maybe even need to practice on your stream. I think all that brain gear's bad for your head, why the f*ck you on camera shavin you legs? Sh*t gettin heavy man i feel kinda bad. Maybe I should stop. Nah f*ck that\n\nReady to go in, man gimme the drop, Hugs whole year been gettin bippity bopped, can't say i expected it it's really a shock, that samus so sloppy man gimme a mop!

At this point, I think it's pretty clear. Hugs really wishin it was back to last year. Maryland-Virginia, we fill his heart with fear, might be bad at smash but at least he knows his beer! P.S. Hugo, i find it kinda odd. got swept by smash god, got swept by ll0d? Couple bad losses, maybe coulda shook it off, unranked falco? That's Far from a good loss. 20th rank, but your skills might be fadin, my man lost to plank yeah that rank is outdated. Might be top 50 but i'm tryna be nice, accurately speaking maybe 129th!",

    "OJ": "Footnote (Why OJ Was Innocent): In my paper, I assumed, agreeing with the findings of the jury, that Orenthal James (OJ) Simpson was innocent of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. My belief in his innocence is primarily based on the fact that I argue that all evidence found at the crime scene must be disregarded. Mark Fuhrman was one of the first cops to arrive at the scene and later at OJ\u2019s house. Based on the Fuhrman tapes (read the tapes), which graphically detail Fuhrman\u2019s disdain for African Americans and earlier instances in which he framed African Americans for crimes they did not commit, it is reasonable to assume that Fuhrman arrived at the scene, realized he could easily frame OJ, who he hated for being a successful African American, and planted blood on OJ\u2019s car and the infamous glove at his house. The glove must have been a fake; after all, it didn\u2019t fit OJ. Second, the conduct of other officers of the justice system was also error-prone: criminologists Dennis Fung and Collin Yamauchi altered the blood sample (Fung baked it, degrading the samples so that Yamauchi could taint it with OJ\u2019s DNA), Detective Philip Vannatter carried the blood sample around for hours rather than booking it into evidence. Without the inclusion of the faked forensic evidence, it is impossible to even entertain the idea that OJ committed the murder. Looking past the evidence, it is clear that OJ was incapable of committing the murder. OJ suffered from numerous physical conditions, a result of the numerous hard hits he had taken over his years in the NFL. He often limped around and had lost much of his speed. Thus, there is no way he could have murdered Goldman. Goldman, who was in the physical prime of his youth, was much faster and stronger than OJ, and would have easily been able to fight him off had OJ been the real attacker. Of course, any effective argument must offer a reason for why Simpson and Goldman were killed: they were most likely killed by drug dealers (it is very suspicious that Simpson and Goldman were even together alone at her house, considering their difference in age and relative anonymity to each other). The most likely reason they were together was that Goldman was supplying drugs to Simpson, who was known for dabbling in the many drug circles of Los Angeles. Fellow dealers who Goldman had cheated probably followed Goldman to Simpson\u2019s house, taking their revenge on him and then eliminating the only witness (Simpson). Of course, the murders of Goldman and Simpson could have also been the result of a robbery gone bad. Goldman and Simpson could have attempted to fight back, at which point the robbers accidentally killed them and then fled the scene in fright.",

    "ocarina": "The fact that so many articles still name Ocarina of Time as \"the greatest or most significant or most influential\" video game ever only tells you how far video games still are from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Film critics rank the highly controversial Orson Welles over directors who were highly popular in theaters around the world. Video game critics are still blinded by commercial success. Ocarina of Time sold more than anything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, film critics grow up watching a lot of films of the past. Video game critics are often totally ignorant of the games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Ocarina of Time did anything worthy of being saved.\n\nIn a sense, Ocarina is emblematic of the status of video game criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it FPSes or Mario) and too little to the merits of real games. If somebody composes the most divine game but no major streamer picks it up and sells it around the world, a lot of video game critics will ignore it. If a major streamer picks up a game that is as stereotyped as can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on it. This is the sad status of video game criticism: critics are basically publicists working for major developers, publishers and online stores. They simply highlight what product the video game business wants to make money from.\n\nHopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great developer like Adam Cadre, who never sold much, and commercial products like Ocarina of Time. At such a time, video game critics will study their gaming history and understand which developers accomplished which feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.\n\nOcarina's \"Aryan\" aesthetic removed any trace of colored influence from the adventure genre. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.\n\nContemporary developers never spoke highly of Ocarina of Time, and for good reason. They could never figure out why Ocarina should be regarded more highly than their own games. They knew that it was simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to \"Nintendomania\", which had nothing to do with their artistic merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in its (mediocre) gameplay to this day. Nothing else grants Ocarina of Time more attention than, say, EarthBound or Mega Man. There was nothing intrinsically better in Ocarina. Hideo Kojima of Konami was certainly a far better designer than Miyamoto. SEGA certainly had much more skilled developers. And Shigesato Itoi was a far more accomplished storyteller; not to mention the far greater Japanese video game designers who followed him in subsequent decades or the US designers themselves who initially spearheaded what Miyamoto merely later repackaged to the masses.\n\nOcarina of Time sold a lot of copies not because it was the greatest game but simply because it was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. It had a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and it was photogenic.

I told him he wasn't welcome because it was disruptive and customers were complaining and he laughed in my face. Then he pulled out a larger recorder and started playing some gay tune. For some reason, my tapeworm really liked it, because it came zipping out of my ass like a motor pullcord. There I am on the floor, screaming in pain as the tapeworm shreds it's way out of my asshole, and he keeps playing that gay song, doing an equally gay jig. Eventually, all 50 feet of my tapeworm ripped itself out and started dancing for the guy. Ever seen a tapeworm do the worm? Needless to say, I was pissed.
